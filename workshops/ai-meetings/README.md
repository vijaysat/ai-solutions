Welcome to this tutorial on building a web application using Visual Builder Cloud Service! In this tutorial, we'll embark on an exciting journey of leveraging cutting-edge technologies to enhances team meetings by using Oracle AI Database and OCI AI Services for seamless real-time audio transcription, efficient summarization, and easy interrogation of transcriptions. It extracts sentiment, reduces administrative tasks, and provides data-driven insights. This solution, turns meeting data into actionable intelligence and boosts overall productivity.

# **1. Prepare your user**

In Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), API keys are used for secure authentication when accessing OCI resources through REST APIs. OCI API keys consist of two parts: a Public key and a Private key. You use the OCI console to generate the Private/Public key pair.
Generate API Keys using OCI Console
To Generate the API Keys using OCI Console:

- Login into your OCI Account.

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/ak1.png)
- Click on the Profile icon at the top-right corner and select your Profile hyperlink.

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/ak2.png)
- Under Resources section at the bottom-left, select API Keys and then click Add API Key.

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/ak3.png)
- The Add API Key dialog is displayed. Select Generate API Key Pair to create a new key pair.

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/ak4.png)
- Click Download Private Key. A .pem file is saved to your local device. You do not need to download the public key and click Add button.

# **2. Pick you compartment**
Identify the compartment you're currently working within. Navigate to 'Identity' -> 'Compartments'. Locate your compartment and make a note of its OCID (Oracle Cloud Identifier)



# **3. Create a bucket to store your meetings**

Create a bucket in your compartment. Navigate to 'Storage' -> 'Object Storage & Archive Storage' -> 'Buckets, Click on "Create bucket" button, provide for instance AI_Meetings and click on "Create".

# **4. Open Visual Builder**

## Configure access to REST APIs

* Open Visual Builder and click on the "New" button. Provide a name and an ID, for example "AI_Meetings". Click on finish.

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/vbcs1.jpg)

* Now we are going to create a web application. Click on the first icon (web applications)

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/vbcs2.jpg)

* Now, click on the "+ Web Application" button

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/vbcs3.jpg)

* Provide an Application name, for example "AI_Meetings"

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/vbcs4.jpg)

* Let's do the REST Service definition. Click on "+ Service Connection" button

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/vbcs5.jpg)

* Choose source "Define by Endpoint"

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/vbcs6.jpg)

* Provide the OCI Object Storage API Endpoint, being xx-xxxxxx-x your region (example: eu-frankfurt-1). For instance https://objectstorage.xx-xxxxxx-x.oraclecloud.com/n/{namespace}/b/AI_Meetings/o/{objectName}

    Enter the Backend Name and select 'Oracle Cloud Infrastructure API Signature 1.0' from the Authentication dropdown menu. Then, click on the pencil icon to proceed

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/vbcs7.jpg)

* Enter the data obtained in step 1 in the format ocid.tenancy/ocid.user/key_fingerprint. Paste the content of the Private key file that you downloaded in the first step, then click the 'Save' button. Afterward, proceed by clicking on the 'Next' button

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/vbcs8.jpg)

* Include a "service name" and choose "Method" GET and set "Action Hint" to "Get one"

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/vbcs9.jpg)

* Click on create to finish the wizard. Now, you have an Object Storage backend.

Let's go to add a new service to the recently created backend OCI Storage API to upload objects and create Preauthenticated requests.

So, add a new service to the storage backend
[URL]: vb-catalog://backends/objectStorage/n/{object_storage_namespace}/b/{bucket}/o/{object_name}

- "Method": PUT
- "Action hint": CREATE
- Dynamic Headers:
  - Content-Type required, type String
  - Contetn-Disposition required as String
- Request body media type: application/octect-stream

Again, add a new service to the storage backend
   vb-catalog://backends/objectStorage/n/{object_storage_namespace}/b/{bucket}/p/

- "Method": POST
- "Action hint": CREATE
- Dynamic Headers:
    - Content-Type required, type String
    - Content-Disposition required as String
- Request body media type: application/octect-stream

- Repeat the same operation to provide access to the OCI GenAI API to do summarization (select 'Oracle Cloud Infrastructure API Signature 1.0' from the Authentication dropdown menu as you have done with other backends)

    So, add a new backend and set the URL

    https://inference.generativeai.xx-xxxxxx-x.oci.oraclecloud.com/20231130/actions/generateText

    - "Method": POST
    - "Action hint": CREATE
    - Request body:

        ```json
        {
        "compartmentId":"ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaxxxxxnauu3aajpx6pfgtwrxq",
        "extractiveness": "AUTO",
        "format": "AUTO",
        "input": "From the deluge on that election Sunday of 28 March, just one year ago today, to the sweltering epilogue of this scorching May, with the European elections on the horizon.........",
        "length": "AUTO",
          "servingMode": {
                "modelId": "cohere.command",
                "servingType": "ON_DEMAND"
            },
        "temperature": 0.1
        }
        ```

    - Response body:

        ```json
        {
            "id": "0fa30f70-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-a1697b0d4d68",
            "summary": "A year on from the 28th February coup attempt in Spain, the country is gearing up for European elections while the government continues to push through controversial legislation, such as the Amnesty Law, despite widespread opposition and protests. .........",
            "modelId": "cohere.command",
            "modelVersion": "15.6"
        }
        ```

* Repeat the same operation to provide access to the OCI Speech API to carry out the transcription. On this case we will be able to get transcription status (select 'Oracle Cloud Infrastructure API Signature 1.0' from the Authentication dropdown menu as you have done with other backends)

    So, add a new backend and set the URL (https://speech.aiservice.xx-xxxxxxxxx-x.oci.oraclecloud.com/20220101/transcriptionJobs/{transcriptionJobId})

    - "Method": GET
    - "Action hint": Get Many
    - Request body:

* Lastly add a custom endpoint to provide RAG capabilities around the transcription.
    - Add the endpoint http://xxx.xx.xxx.xxx:8888/v2/answer/?conv_id={id}
    - We will cover in another session how to create a RAG solution.

* So, finally your service connections will be something similar to this image:

## Create business objects

* Choose business objects panel and add two tables:
    * Meetings: add a string field like meetingName
    * Transcriptions: add some string fields: jobID, jobName and status

        ![alt text](AImeetings-md/vbcs10b.jpg)

## Build the Web App

- First of all you must create some types &  variables:
    * Type tokenType is a object of spearkerIndex (number) and token (string)
    * Define also following variables:
        * String type: filename, meetingName, jobIdName, jobStatus, parURL, outputlocation, transcriptionText, summaryText, mention, ...
        * Boolean type: loading, uploadSuccess, meetingCreated, transcriptionTask, summaryStatus,  summary, spareTime, ragResponse, query,...
        * Number: fileSize, nParticipants,meetingID, transcriptionID, jobId, positive, negative, mixed, neutral, ...
        * String array: requirements, ...
        * tokenType array: tokenArray, ...


- In the components panel, search for "file picker" and drag it onto your canvas. To enhance its appearance, click on the grid layout and switch it to "Flex" mode (found in the properties panel). Set the "Direction" to "vertical" and justify it both "center" and "middle". Next, navigate to the "All" tab, type "style" into the search bar, and provide some CSS styling such as "margin-top:30px;" to achieve the desired spacing. Drop a few components like images and texts.

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/vbcs11.jpg)

- In the File Picker properties panel provided the supported files that your application will support.

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/vbcs12.jpg)

- In the file picker create an event. On this event, you will manage the file upload to the object storage.

- Drop an input text to capture the meeting name and a button to create the meeting. So, you can associate a string variable to the input text (example meetingName). We will create the meeting metadata on the business object
- Associate an ojAction event to the button (it's the action chain):

          return;
        }
      }

      return createMeeting;
    });
    ```

* Now we will create another Action chain to create the transcription job using the Speech service. We will provide information as the compartment, bucket, object and we will update the Transcription table with the relevant information.

    ```

- Due to it's a sync request, we are going to create a refresh button to check the current transcription status.

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/vbcs13.jpg)

- Create an Action event asociated to the button to refresh the page

    ```js
    define([
      'vb/action/actionChain',
      'vb/action/actions',
      'vb/action/actionUtils',
    ], (
      ActionChain,
      Actions,
      ActionUtils
    ) => {
      'use strict';

      class ButtonActionRefresh extends ActionChain {

        /**
         * @param {Object} context
         */
        async run(context) {
          const { $page, $flow, $application } = context;
          window.location.href = window.location.href;
        }
      }

      return ButtonActionRefresh;
    });
    ```


- It's time to create an event listener to get the status also when your open the page. So create a vbEnter event with an Action Chain named loadData.

- Now, let's drop and configure some components to show the information.

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/drop.jpg)

- Sample use case:

    ![alt text](AImeetings-md/sample.png)

- If you want to import my project and start to use it, please first of all you must do some configurations.
    * Edit server configurations to add your credentials (user ocid, user fingerprint, tenant ocid and your private certificate)
    * Provide values to application variables: namespace, bucket & your ocid compartmment.

*I hope you liked it. From today you can make your meetings smarter!*
